# Roadmap

This repository is used by Sidestream Auction Services (SAS) core unit of MakerDAO to share, discuss and iterate our [roadmap](https://github.com/makerdao-sas/Roadmap/projects/1) with the Maker community. 

### Structure
Our roadmap follows a standard Kanban structure. 
The items currently listed in the `Blocked` column are already staged to be tackled next but require some preliminary discussions, decisions or actions to start implementation.

Each roadmap item is assigned to at least one label. We use the labels to represent different work modules that lie within our responsibility and are geared towards our mission to provide and maintain auction services. Following a quick breakdown of existing work modules:

* **Unified Auction UI:** Features that pay into the goal of having a unified and highly accessible User Interface that covers all auction related interaction points 
* **Auction Analytics:** Features that allow to derive the highest possible value from past auction data
* **Backstop auction keeper ecosystem:** Features and work items that ensure to have a robust and well-functioning auction keeper ecosystem in each market condition
* **Auction Infrastructure:** Work items that support a robust infrastructure for all auction related services to rely upon
* **Notification & alert systems:** Features that help to increase awareness and participation in the protocol as a whole and auctions in particular
* **Dev Practices:** Work items that support the highest possible code quality and drive efficiency of our development practices
* **Standardization:** Documentation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), guides and checklists
* **MVP:** Features included in our first MVP with the goal to enable UI-based auction participation via flash lending functionality
